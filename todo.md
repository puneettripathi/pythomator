## Pythomator - Python Automator
### This file will be base for all things we create for pythomator 
Below are the functionalities it will have -
* a process that monitors a filesystem
* event based file trigger - certain actions to take on the file arrival
* workflow - job chain| steps| process
* hooks - ssh(primarily)=> this is where the job gets submitted
* UI - so that one can know what states are the running processes in
* GUI - possibly later but certainly good to have
